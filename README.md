# Auction

A lab on doing bidding logic in elixir where each auction is represented by it's own process.

Initially created on the "Holiday hacknight" (<http://www.meetup.com/stockholm-elixir/events/227496385/>).

Usage:

    mix test

## Todo

Things that would be interesting to try.

* [ ] Add the max bid concept (since this affects persistence)
* [ ] Add persistence
* [ ] Add benchmark suite simulating users viewing and placing bids in a realistic manner and a realistic number of bids for any particular auction
  - How many auctions could a small computer, e.g. heroku instance or laptop, handle?
* [ ] Add auction-closing logic and a event to hook into when that happens
* [ ] Add supervision and restarting of auctions
* [ ] Figure out how to ensure only one machine handles the same unique auction at a time, and handle failover
